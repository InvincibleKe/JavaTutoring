# Tutorial 3 - Interfaces
Interfaces are used in Java as a kind of contract to force a class to comply
with a set of rules we define.

An interface is a kind of sketch for a class. We include methods (without any
implementation details) that we would like to see in a class that implements it.
Again, similar to functions, this allows us to enforce types in the methods that
a class uses so we can write more general code.

## Defining Interfaces
So, if we have an interface:

```Java
public interface Vehicle {
    public double getMph();
    public double getMilesPerGallon();
}
```

Then we can create a car class (again...):

```Java
public class Car implements Vehicle {
    private double mph;
    private double mpg;

    public static double getMph() {
        return mph;
    }

    public static double getMilesPerGallon() {
        return mpg;
    }
}
```

The `Car` class implements the `Vehicle` interface, and as such, it must
implement the methods specified by the Vehicle interface, filling out the body
of the methods and complying with the return types and the parameters passed to
the methods.

We can use the interface to create another class:

```Java
public class Bus implements Vehicle {
    private double mph;
    private double mpg;

    public static double getMph() {
        return mph;
    }

    public static double getMilesPerGallon() {
        return mpg;
    }
}
```

Which also follows the sketch defined by the interface.

## The use of Interfaces
We can look to the tutorial code to see how useful interfaces are. If we have
two classes, `BankAccount` and `Country`:

```Java
public class BankAccount {

    private double balance;

	public double getBalance() {
		return this.balance;
	}
}

public class Country {

	private double area;

	public double getArea() {
		return this.area;
	}

}
```

With an additional class `Statistics` which calculates the average of an
array list of bank account balances and country area:

```Java
public class Statistics {

	public static double average(BankAccount[] accounts) {
		double sum = 0.0;
		for(int i = 0; i < accounts.length; i++) {
			sum += accounts[i].getBalance();
		}
		return sum/accounts.length;
	}

	public static double average(Country[] countries) {
		double sum = 0.0;
		for(int i = 0; i < countries.length; i++) {
			sum += countries[i].getArea();
		}
		return sum/countries.length;
	}
}
```

But, as we can see from the two pieces of code, there are a lot of similarities.
This is pretty wasteful and more code means more possible bugs, so we want to
reduce the code base (amount of code) as much as possible.

This is where interfaces come in handy. We can define an interface `Measurable`:

```Java
public interface Measurable {
	public double getMeasure();
}
```
The measurable interface enables us to use a type `Measurable` that is, as long
as a class implements the `Measurable` interface we can use it as a type
constraint (when passing values etc).

If we re-write the classes `BankAccount` and `Country` we get:

```Java
public class BankAccount implements Measurable {

	private double balance;

    // The method enforced by the interface
	@Override
	public double getMeasure() {
		return this.balance;
	}

}

public class Country implements Measurable {

	private double area;

    // The method enforced by the interface
	@Override
	public double getMeasure() {
		return this.area;
	}
}
```

Then we can generalise the code in `Statistics`:

```Java
public class Statistics {

	public static double average(Measurable[] m) {
		double sum = 0.0;
		for(int i = 0; i < m.length; i++) {
			sum += m[i].getMeasure();
		}
		return sum/m.length;
	}
}
```

Which uses `Measurable` in the `average` method as the type of array we expect
to be passed to the method! This allows us to pass any type of class to the
method that implements the `Measurable` interface, which improves code re-use.
