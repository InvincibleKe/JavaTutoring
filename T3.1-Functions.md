# Tutorial 3 - Functions

Functions are a useful addition to Java and allow us to generalise our code more.
This has a number of benefits, with the primary one being that we can write less
code. Remember:

## Function Syntax
Function syntax is a little odd. But it does make sense once explained. We can
define a function with `Function<Integer, Integer> myFun`. This function is
called `myFun` and it takes an integer value (the first `Integer` in
`<Integer, Integer>`) and returns an integer (the second `Integer` in
`<Integer, Integer>`). If we instead wanted it to return a boolean value we can
write: `Function<Integer, Boolean> myFun`.

## Declaring functions
We can declare a named function in code in the following way:

```Java
Function<Integer, Integer> f = x -> {
	return new Integer(x+1);
};
```

Which takes an integer value as a parameter (`x`) and returns an integer value
of `x+1`. As a traditional method, this would be:

```Java
public static int f(int x) {
    return x+1;
}
```

So the `x -> ...` is just telling us what the name of the passed variable will
be in the following code, just like a parameter in traditional methods.

## Passing functions as a parameter
Functions give us a huge amount of flexibility in the way we write code when we
pass them as parameters to methods.

We can have a method `applyFunc` which applies a function to each element in an
array, with the function taking a `Integer` value and returning a `Boolean`:

```Java
public static int[] applyFunc (int[] a, Function<Integer,Boolean> myFunc) {
    for(int i = 0; i < a.length; i++) {
        if(myFunc.apply(a[i])) {
            a[i] *= a[i];
        }
    }
    return a;
}
```

This method squares all numbers in the passed array if they satisfy some
condition specified by the function `myFunc` which we also pass to the method as
a parameter.

Java doesn't care about the function we pass to the method, as long as it
complies to the defined input type and output type. Using this, we can delay the
evaluation of the function until later in the code (we can write the function
further down) because we enforce the input and output (java doesn't care
what the function actually does). 

So, if we call the method with:
```Java
int[] arr = {1,2,3,4,5};
applyFunc(arr, x -> {return x == 2;});
```

Which will return the array `[1,4,3,4,5]` since we check for equality with 2.
Only one element (index 1) is equal to 2, so this will be the only squared value.

The beauty of these functions is that we can easily swap out this function for
another.

```Java
int[] arr = {1,2,3,4,5};
applyFunc(arr, x -> {return x != 2;});
```

By altering just a single line of code, the method now squares any numbers that
are not equal to 2 (returning `[1,2,9,16,25]`).

We can also add multiple statements to the function (making our own mini program):

```Java
int[] arr = {1,2,3,4,5};
applyFunc(arr, x -> {
    x += 10; // Multiple lines!
    return x > 13;
});
```

This way of defining functions (within the method) is usually used if we only
need it once. If we need to use a function multiple times it's best
to use the named alternative mentioned at the start.
